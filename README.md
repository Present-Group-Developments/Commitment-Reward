The Initiai Commit by Present Group Developments, indicated on the repository landing page, is the PDF version of the README following GitHub guidelines. 
This Project is currently live, being undertaken manually with a client. It requires developers to turn it into a system and subsequently maintain that system. 
The proposal for the Project is being submitted to Polkadot for their consideration. 
Only developers familiar with the Parity-Polkadot-Kusama (Polkadot) coding toolsets, Polkadot ecosystem and endorsed by Polkadot will be authorised on the project.

**This constitutes a public announcement of the connection of the Project to Polkadot as stipulated in the Project Submission Requirements.**

This is the sole reason for designating this repository as Public rather than Private. It may be redesignated as Private in accordance with directions from Polkadot. 
Further to this, Present Group Developments can state that the Project is not under any legal, regulatory or community scrutiny. 
A License Type of 'None' has currently been selected for this repository. Polkadot will advise of the correct License Type to select in due course. 
Present Group Developments are seasoned business people, seeking to collaborate with Polkadot on this and future projects, working with their specified developers. 
Consequently, Present Group Developments are not familiar with the GitHub environment, since they are not developers, and so may put items in the wrong places. 
The link to the Google Docs version of the README document is given in the 'Extended Description' section at the bottom of this page. 
It may be the case that the link to the google docs document is password protected. The password will be submitted with the project proposal. 
A PDF version of the Polkadot Project Proposal has been committed / uploaded to the Commitment-Reward repository since Google Slides is inadequate to the task. 
Since the proposal contains proprietary information, the PDF version has been password protected. This password will be provided in the Polkadot Project Proposal.
